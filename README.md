# follystatus

A foolish little project that uses LLM magic to generate ridiculous, and satirical HTTP status messages.
**Perfectly Useless** and **mildly entertaining**.

### Why?

Because internet could use more silliness.

### Some Examples

	- > Good grief! This payload is larger than the universe itself and just as useless.
	- > 413 you say? Oh, it's not you, it's me. I'm just too small to carry the weight of your ambitions.

- 409 - Conflict  ( from *Marvin the Paranoid Android* )
	- > Oh joy, another 409. Because clearly, the universe wasn't chaotic enough.
 	- > Another lovely example of intelligent life form incompetence. Bravo.
